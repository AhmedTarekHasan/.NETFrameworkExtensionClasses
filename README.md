# .NET Framework Extension Classes
### Some .NET Framework Extension Classes With Some Great Helpful Functions

<br/>

"Extension methods" was first introduced in .NET 3.5 (C#3/VB9). It is a feature which lets you extend existing classes with new methods without the need to inherit from these classes. These classes are probably to be closed ones without access to their source code, otherwise, why extend the class when I can edit its code freely?!!!

<br/>

Writing an extension method is so similar to writing a static class which wraps or uses the class which I want to extend. Actually there is always a debate on whether to use static classes or use extension methods. Me myself, I prefer to use extension methods because I think it makes the code more readable as you don't need to break the context to make use of a static method.
